// JAVA Basics
JDK consists of
Development tools + JRE ( JAVA class library + JVM)

when we run javac First.java --> that java file is converted into bytecode with the help of JDK and this bytecode i.e First.class file is executed with the help of JVM inside JRE.

JDK 17 is LTS (Long Term Support) means stable version with no bugs.

In the java code methods are always called using brackets for eg main(), println() etc

System.out.println() --> System is a class, out is an object and println is a method

Scanner - to use scanner we have to import util package
System.out --> attached to the monitor
System.in --> take input from keyboard 

import java.util.*;
Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

int a,b,c;
System.out.println("Enter 2 Nos");
a = sc.nextInt();
b = sc.nextInt();

c = a+b;
s.o.p("sum of 2 no's is", c);

nextInt() -> Reads integer
nextFloat() -> Reads float value
nextDouble() -> Reads double value
next() -> it ready only first word in the string i.e if we enter "how are you" from keyword only "how" is taken, to consider entire sentence we have to use nextLine
nextLine() -> Reads entire sentence
nextByte() 
nextShort()
nextLong()
nextBoolean()

hasNextInt() -> Return true or false based on checking if next value is integer or not
hasNextFloat() 

useRadix(2) ->takes binary value and return decimal value

If we want to know all the methods available inside the scanner then we have to use command "javap java.util.scanner" but this cmd is not working in latest JDK.
